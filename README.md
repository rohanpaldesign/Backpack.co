# Backpack.co

Hello!

Backpack.co is a project to make a travel website. I am just learning to code and just a beginner in Javascript. I am trying to add up as much new elements I can to create a really professional website. This is one of my very first websites to code and I have planned to create this a really functional project just for fun. 
So, I myself am designing the structure and then coding it.

I am also participating in this 100 Days of Code thing and that is really motivating me to build something more into this. I am still a learner, so please don't take this super seriously.

Take a look at the website here:  https://rohanpalhappy.github.io/Backpack.co/

Thanks!
